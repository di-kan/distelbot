# Distelbot
**Distelbot** is a showcase **bot**, that runs as a server using **Python**.
It retrieves currency exchange information from [https://exchangerate.host/](https://exchangerate.host/) in regular intervals, and at the same time creates one bot on [Discord Server](https://discord.com/) and one on [Telegram messenger](https://telegram.org/)
Then the user can type commands at the message box that can display exchange rate information:
* **/search <string>:** Searches the data for currency
* **/get <name1> <name2>** ...: Returns rate exchange information for all currencies separated by a space
* **/top10:** Shows the top 10 most competitive currencies in relation to the Base (EUR)
* **/age:** shows age of the data that the bot contains

The functionality is basic, but It can be ammended with any imaginable feature.

Here are two screenshots while the bots are running
